# Feature list

To address the problem of the agent one-shotting an app or prematurely considering the project complete, we prompted the initializer agent to write a comprehensive file of feature requirements expanding on the user’s initial prompt. In the claude.ai clone example, this meant over 200 features, such as “a user can open a new chat, type in a query, press enter, and see an AI response.” These features were all initially marked as “failing” so that later coding agents would have a clear outline of what full functionality looked like.

```json
{
  "category": "functional",
  "description": "New chat button creates a fresh conversation",
  "steps": [
    "Navigate to main interface",
    "Click the 'New Chat' button",
    "Verify a new conversation is created",
    "Check that chat area shows welcome state",
    "Verify conversation appears in sidebar"
  ],
  "passes": false
}
```
